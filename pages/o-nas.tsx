	"The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. That's crazy. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Son of a gun. That's crazy. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. It's cold, but it's beautiful. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.";

const textMock2 =
	"If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Just make a decision and let it go. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. There comes a nice little fluffer. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Use what you see, don't plan it.";
